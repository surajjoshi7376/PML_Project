# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning web application that predicts house prices based on user input features. The model is trained using real housing data and deployed using Flask to provide an interactive interface for predictions.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end ML pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
